# PredictingTitanicSurvival

This project was part of the Machine Learning course at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In the course, we were taught the basic principles, methodology, and algorithms of machine learning.

As a final project, we were to write a 10-page report in which we present a specific research question around some machine learning task, implementing one or more algorithms, and properly analyze the results. I chose to write a report named "Predicting survival on the Titanic with Machine Learning models", using data from the Kaggle competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster". In this report, I implemented and evaluated five machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, kNN, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines) to see which of them would perform the best in predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

"PredictingTitanicSurvival.ipynb" is the notebook which you can run yourself, and which uses "test.csv" and "train.csv" as input.

"PredictingTitanicSurvivalNotebookPDF.pdf" is simply a PDF of the notebook, and "PredictingTitanicSurvivalReport.pdf" is the final report I handed in for the course, which does not showcase any code but is more theoretically detailed, containing descriptions of the algorithms along with references.
